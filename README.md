# Food-101 Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify images of food into one of 101 categories with high accuracy. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as the foundation and fine-tunes it on the Food-101 dataset. The goal is to accurately predict the category of food from images, which can be applied in nutritional apps and food tracking applications.
